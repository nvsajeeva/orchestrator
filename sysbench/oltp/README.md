## Usage

If you have a container running mysql, you will need to check on what network it is, and what IP address it has assigned.
You can do so with the following command:

```
# docker inspect agustin_N_PXC_pxc_node01
...
            "Networks": {
                "agustinnpxc_pxc_network": {
                    "IPAMConfig": {
                        "IPv4Address": "172.29.0.2"
                    },
...
```

Then, you can run this container like:

```
# docker run --rm -d --name agustin-sysbench \
--network=agustinnpxc_pxc_network \
-e MYSQL_HOST=172.29.0.2 \
guriandoro/sysbench:0.5-6.4 /entrypoint.sh
```

If you are using the default network, you can ommit the `--network` argument.

Note that you can use this even if the mysql server is not running in a container; you just have to know the IP address.

To run it against a sandbox instance executing in the host, you can use (MYSQL_PORT was added in `0.5-6.2`):

```
docker run --rm -it --name agustin-sysbench \
--network=host \
-e MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1 \
-e MYSQL_PASS="msandbox" \
-e MYSQL_PORT=5633 \
-e NUM_THREADS=15 \
guriandoro/sysbench:0.5-6.4 bash
```

You can also use `NO_PREPARE=1` and/or `NO_RUN=1` to skip the prepare and/or run phases, respectively.

## Checking its status

You can use `docker logs -f <container_name>` to check on its status. You should see something like the following, if successful:

```
# docker logs -f agustin-sysbench
======= Using the following variables =======
OLTP_TEST /usr/share/doc/sysbench/tests/db/oltp.lua
OLTP_TABLE_SIZE 250000
MYSQL_HOST 172.29.0.2
MYSQL_USER root
MYSQL_PASS root
MYSQL_DB test
REPORT_INTERVAL 1
MAX_REQUESTS 0
TX_RATE 10

```

You can get error messages if you don't set any of the variables to what they should be, like:

```
======= Executing sysbench [OPTIONS] prepare =======
sysbench 0.5:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark

FATAL: unable to connect to MySQL server, aborting...
FATAL: error 1045: Access denied for user 'noroot'@'172.29.0.3' (using password: YES)

======= Executing sysbench [OPTIONS] run =======
PANIC: unprotected error in call to Lua API (Failed to connect to the database)
```

## Another way of running

You may find that `docker logs -f <container_name>` lags a bit while showing output, and you would prefer to get a more dynamic view of what's going on. In this case, you can simply run the container with an interactive bash shell, and run the entrypoint.sh script manually, like:

```
# docker run --rm -it --name agustin-sysbench \
> --network=agustinnpxc_pxc_network \
> -e MYSQL_HOST=172.29.0.2 \
> guriandoro/sysbench:0.5-6.4 /bin/bash
[root@90e3294d7ef9 /]# sh entrypoint.sh 
======= Using the following variables =======
OLTP_TEST /usr/share/doc/sysbench/tests/db/oltp.lua
OLTP_TABLE_SIZE 250000
MYSQL_HOST 172.29.0.2
MYSQL_USER root
MYSQL_PASS root
MYSQL_DB test
REPORT_INTERVAL 1
MAX_REQUESTS 0
TX_RATE 10

======= Executing sysbench [OPTIONS] prepare =======
sysbench 0.5:  multi-threaded system evaluation benchmark
...
```

## Configurable variables

You can check the entrypoint.sh code, or refer to the following list (although it may not be 100% updated at any time):

```
MYSQL_HOST -- this is the only variable that doesn't have a default value set, so it's compulsory 

MYSQL_USER="${MYSQL_USER:-root}"
MYSQL_PASS="${MYSQL_PASS:-root}"
MYSQL_DB="${MYSQL_DB:-test}"
MYSQL_PORT="${MYSQL_PORT:-3306}"

OLTP_TEST="${OLTP_TEST:-/usr/share/doc/sysbench/tests/db/oltp.lua}"
OLTP_TABLE_SIZE="${OLTP_TABLE_SIZE:-250000}"
OLTP_TABLES_COUNT="${OLTP_TABLES_COUNT:-1}"

NUM_THREADS="${NUM_THREADS:-1}"
REPORT_INTERVAL="${REPORT_INTERVAL:-1}"
MAX_REQUESTS="${MAX_REQUESTS:-0}"
MAX_TIME="${MAX_TIME:-0}"
TX_RATE="${TX_RATE:-10}"

NO_PREPARE="${NO_PREPARE:-0}"
NO_RUN="${NO_RUN:-0}"
```

To override any of these values, add them as `-e VARIABLE_NAME=value` to the `docker run` command.
